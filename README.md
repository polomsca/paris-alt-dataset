# What makes Paris look like Paris (alternative dataset)

If you are coming from the Meetup (https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/228275379/), this is code I have so far for an alternative method to generate a dataset to analyze a la (http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/whatMakesParis/). Hope this is useful; I might return to this if I have time.
